# CustomAlbums .NET 6.0
Full rewrite of [gamrguy/CustomAlbums](https://github.com/gamrguy/CustomAlbums) in .NET 6.0.  
Currently in development, not ready for use.

## Dependencies
- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases) v0.6 or higher
- [Muse Dash on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774171/Muse_Dash/)

## Building
- Install MelonLoader into Muse Dash and run it once.
- Run SetPath.cmd as administrator and follow the instructions.
- Build tested with Visual Studio 2022, MelonLoader 0.6.1, Muse Dash 3.12.1.
- DO NOT use MelonLoader 0.6.2, it is incredibly broken.
